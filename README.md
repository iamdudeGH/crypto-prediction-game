# My GenLayer Learning Journey

This repository contains my Intelligent Contracts built on GenLayer.

## What is GenLayer?

GenLayer is the first Intelligent Blockchain that enables smart contracts to:
- Access the internet
- Process natural language using AI
- Make subjective decisions
- Go beyond deterministic logic

## My Contracts

### 1. Hello Contract (`my_first_contract.py`)

**Features:**

- Count how many times someone has been greeted
- Change the name through transactions

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install GenLayer (when available)
# Run the contract on GenLayer testnet
```
